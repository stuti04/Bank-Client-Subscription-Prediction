# Classification of Customer Subscription in Banking

### Project Description

A series of direct marketing campaigns using phone calls were conducted by the Portuguese banking institutions to promote a term deposit to its customers. Here, a term deposit is a financial product where a customer deposits an amount with the bank for a fixed period at a predetermined interest rate. One of the main objectives of these marketing campaigns is to encourage clients to subscribe to a term deposit and this can be a source of revenue for the bank. The UCI Bank Marketing Dataset is a valuable resource for financial institutions to make data driven decisions in their marketing efforts. We intend to build predictive models (classification) to help the bank optimize its marketing campaigns and thereby improve subscription rates. This further extends to predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit and gain insights into the efficacy of various marketing strategies.
